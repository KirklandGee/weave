### AI Integration
- **Embeddings support** - Content vectorization for semantic search
- **LLM context generation** - Automatic context building for AI interactions
  - All LLM related calls, work, and features should route through the existing service
  - New features should extend the current infrastructure, not create separate or parallel systems
- **Smart suggestions** - AI-powered relationship recommendations

## Development Patterns

### Database Operations
```typescript
// Factory pattern for campaign-specific operations
const nodeOps = createNodeOps(campaignSlug)
const edgeOps = createEdgeOps(campaignSlug)

// Multi-campaign database isolation
const db = getDb(campaignSlug) // Returns campaign-specific DB instance
```

### State Management
```typescript
// Campaign context for global state
const { currentCampaign, switchCampaign } = useCampaign()

// Reactive database queries
const nodes = useLiveQuery(() => db.nodes.toArray(), [])
```

### Data Synchronization
```typescript
// Background sync with optimistic updates
const changes = await db.changes.toArray()
await pushPull(authFetch, campaignSlug)
```

## Tiptap Editor Architecture (Dual Storage System)

**Design Pattern: JSON-First Editor with Dual Storage**

The Tiptap editor has been refactored to use a dual storage approach that completely separates the user interface from backend data needs:

### **Editor Layer (User Experience)**
- **JSON-Only**: Tiptap editor works exclusively with JSON format (`editorContent`)
- **No Conversions**: Editor never deals with HTML or markdown directly
- **Direct Saves**: JSON is saved to Dexie via debounced saves (400ms) on every keystroke
- **Load Once**: Content only loaded when switching between different notes (`nodeId` change)
- **No Sync Loop**: Editor content is never reset/synchronized during editing sessions

### **Storage Layer (Database)**
```typescript
// Dexie schema includes both formats
interface Note {
  editorJson: object    // Tiptap's native JSON format
  markdown: string      // Generated from JSON for AI/backend use
}
```

### **Data Flow**
```
User Types → JSON in Editor → Debounced Save → Dexie
                                    ↓
                            JSON → Markdown conversion
                                    ↓
                            Both saved to database
```

### **Key Benefits Achieved**
- **Seamless UX**: No content resets, disappearing lines, or typing interruptions
- **AI Context**: Markdown always current in database for LLM operations
- **Performance**: No constant format conversions during editing
- **Clean Architecture**: Single responsibility - UI vs backend data concerns

### **Critical Implementation Details**
- `onContentChange` receives `editor.getJSON()` directly
- `useActiveNode` returns only `editorContent` (no `htmlContent`)  
- Content sync useEffect only triggers on `nodeId` changes, not content changes
- MarkdownPasteExtension removed (conflicted with tiptap-markdown)
- Background JSON→markdown conversion happens invisibly during saves

This pattern ensures the editor remains responsive and stable while maintaining full backend functionality for AI features.

## Debugging Session - Content Contamination Bug Fix

### Problem Description
A critical bug was discovered where editing one note and rapidly switching to another note would cause content contamination - the new note would display or save content from the previously edited note. This occurred when users made edits and quickly navigated between notes before the debounced save completed.

### Root Cause Analysis
The issue was traced to the **TipTap editor's debounced save mechanism**:

1. **Stale Callback Closure**: TipTap uses a 400ms debounced save to batch editor changes
2. **Rapid Node Switching**: When users switched nodes quickly, the old debounced save would still fire
3. **Wrong Target**: The stale debounced save would execute with the old `onContentChange` callback, but the new node was already active
4. **Content Contamination**: This resulted in content from one note being saved to a different note

### Technical Deep Dive
The problematic code was in `components/Tiptap.tsx`:
- `debouncedSave` was memoized with `[onContentChange]` dependency
- When switching nodes rapidly, old debounced saves could fire after the component updated
- The `onContentChange` callback would target the currently active node, not the node that was active when the debounce was created

### Solution Implementation
**Key Fix**: Enhanced content validation in debounced save mechanism

```typescript
// Before: Only checked if component was active
if (isActiveRef.current) {
  onContentChange(htmlToMd(html))
}

// After: Validate content hasn't changed (indicating same node)
const currentContent = content // Captured when debouncer created
if (content === currentContent) {
  onContentChange(htmlToMd(html))
}
```

**Changes Made**:
1. **Content Capture**: Capture the `content` prop when debouncer is created
2. **Dependency Update**: Add `content` to useMemo dependency array to recreate debouncer on node switches  
3. **Validation Check**: Only save if current content matches captured content
4. **Dependency Array**: `[onContentChange, content]` ensures fresh debouncer on node changes

### Secondary Issues Discovered

#### Sync System Deadlock
During debugging, discovered the sync system could get stuck in "syncing" state:
- **Problem**: If a sync operation failed, state remained "syncing" 
- **Result**: All future syncs were blocked indefinitely
- **Fix**: Added timeout mechanism to reset stuck sync states after 10 seconds

#### Performance Issue - Excessive Logging
- **Problem**: useLiveQuery was firing excessively, causing performance degradation
- **Solution**: Added deduplication to content logging to prevent spam

### Key Learnings About the Application

#### Architecture Strengths
1. **Offline-First Design**: IndexedDB with background sync provides excellent user experience
2. **Multi-Campaign Isolation**: Proper database segregation prevents cross-campaign contamination
3. **Reactive Data Flow**: Dexie live queries provide automatic UI updates
4. **Optimistic Updates**: Changes appear immediately while syncing in background

#### Potential Vulnerabilities Identified
1. **Race Conditions**: Rapid UI interactions can create timing-sensitive bugs
2. **Sync State Management**: Complex sync logic can deadlock under error conditions  
3. **Debounced Operations**: Need careful validation to prevent stale operations
4. **Error Recovery**: Systems need robust recovery mechanisms for stuck states

#### Code Quality Observations
1. **Well-Structured**: Clear separation of concerns between hooks, components, and data layers
2. **Type Safety**: Strong TypeScript usage prevents many runtime errors
3. **React Best Practices**: Proper use of hooks, memoization, and cleanup
4. **Extensible Design**: Factory patterns and composition make the codebase maintainable

#### Debugging Methodology Applied
1. **Systematic Approach**: Started with high-level symptoms, narrowed to specific components
2. **Hypothesis-Driven**: Formed and tested specific theories about the root cause
3. **Logging Strategy**: Added targeted logging to trace data flow without performance impact
4. **Minimal Fixes**: Implemented the smallest change that resolved the core issue
5. **Edge Case Consideration**: Added safeguards for related failure modes (sync deadlock)

This debugging session revealed both the robustness of the application's architecture and areas for improvement around race condition handling and error recovery mechanisms.
